# Cellularnautica

A cellular automata exploration suite. Work in progress, public because someone was interested.

Currently completely on the GPU, but a CPU implementation of the CA stuff may be provided too, for use in more gamey settings (at lower resolution).

# Origins

I made a [web based one](https://www.1bardesign.com/games/experiments/ca_explorer/) quite a while ago - it has languished and is not very flexible. The ability to just share a URL is nice, but I've got a feeling either image or text would be just as flexible, and having a downloadable program is less likely to break mysteriously as web browsers advance/devolve.
